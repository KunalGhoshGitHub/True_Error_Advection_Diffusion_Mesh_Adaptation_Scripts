# Utility Files

This repository includes several utility scripts to facilitate various tasks. Below is a summary of each script and the steps required to execute the solver:

# Utility Scripts

- **Cleaning Script:** `./Utills/Cleaning_Script/Clean.py`
  This script is used to clean the working directory by removing unnecessary files.

- **Initial Mesh Copy Script:** `./Utills/Initial_Mesh_Script/Initial_Mesh_Copy.py`
  This script copies the initial mesh file to the current working directory, ensuring it is available for subsequent operations.

- **Jupyter to Python Conversion Script:** `./Utills/Jupyter_Notebook_to_py_convertor/ipynb_to_py_convertion.py`
  This script converts Jupyter Notebook files to Python scripts, facilitating easier integration and execution.

# Steps to Run the Solver

1. **Clean the Directory:** Execute the cleaning script by copying and running it in the current working directory to remove any unnecessary files.
2. **Copy the Initial Mesh File:** Use the initial mesh copy script to ensure the mesh file is placed in the current working directory. Just the copy the script to the current working directory and excute it.
3. **Run the Solver:** Execute either `Solver.py` or `Solver_Control.py` to initiate the solver process.

# Additional Note

Ensure that GMSH version `gmsh-4.12.1-Linux64` is placed just outside the current working directory to ensure compatibility.

## Happy Computational Fluid Dynamics!
